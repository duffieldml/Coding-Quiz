# Coding-Quiz
This is a quiz for testing you knowledge of coding!!!!!!

While you may be expecting a nice and polished application, I can assure you this is not the case.

I was unable to complete everything due to a family emergency that I have been dealing with for the past 4 days.

I have completed as much as I can with everything going on. I will revisit this and finish the application once things settle down.

Can I just say that javascript is tough too? Like, this is some scary kind of tough.

Anyway, I'm getting off topic. This is supposed to be a quiz to test your knowledge of JavaScript. I think I'm going to have to hit the books myself.
